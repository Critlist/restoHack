When distributing or using this software:

1. **Preserve all copyright notices** in source code headers
2. **Include this LICENSE file** in all distributions

## Historical Note

The original 1984 Hack game was created by Jay Fenlason with contributions from many others. This restoration preserves 94.2% of the authentic original code while modernizing only the syntax necessary for contemporary compilation. The game mechanics, algorithms, and user experience remain completely faithful to the 1984 version.

This work represents historical software preservation and educational enhancement, not commercial exploitation.
