I've identified a potential bug in the `addrsx` function in the file `hack.mklev.c`. The variable `rsp` can be used without being initialized, which could lead to a crash or undefined behavior. This can happen when `rsmax` is 0 when the function is called.

I will replace the `addrsx` function with a corrected version that handles this case properly.

First, I need to read the content of `hack.mklev.c`.
